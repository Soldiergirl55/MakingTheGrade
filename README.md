## Description
```
My passion is the military, Soldiers in particular, my project goal is to design a website  
 to help entry level Soldiers learn the enlisted Army ranks and a bit of Army humor.
 
 The website can also help civilians and other military branches learn Army enlisted ranks.

.. what class does, ex( adds padding & changes background color of .main_container )
 
2.  class name ex( rule-set consisting of a selector and a declaration block )
.. what class does, ex( The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. )

3. class name ex(used the attributes id and class.  )
.. what class does, ex( the difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element,
whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.  )
